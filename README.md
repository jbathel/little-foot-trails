## Setup

Running the Django Server
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Running the React Server
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Building

Build script will create a `build` directory with a compiled JavaScript code which will be compatible with most modern browsers. We are using `create-react-app` as a starting point in our app.

```
npm run build
```


## Code Examples

All components are functional and written in Javascript:
We used Context API to 'fetch' global variables 

```javascript
export const Results = () => {
  const [trails, setTrails] = useState([]);
  const {
    tags: [trailTags]
  } = useContext(Context);

  function makeQuery(array, param) {
    let jsonObject = Object.assign({}, array);
    var queryString = Object.keys(jsonObject)
      .map(key => param + "=" + jsonObject[key])
      .join("&");
    return queryString;
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchTrails() {
      let query = makeQuery(trailTags, "tags");
      const results = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/trails/?" + query);
      const trails = await results.json();
      setTrails(trails);
    }
    fetchTrails();
  }, [trailTags]);
```

## Features

- Our Search bar allows you to filter Trails by Family friendly Amenities 
- Users are authenticated using JWT Tokens 
- Authenticated users are able to leave a Review on a Trail 
- Detailed Trail data persists throughout browser sessions using localStorage
- Each Trail has a interactive Map provided by Google Maps API 

Considerations for improvement: 

- Have authenticated users be able to edit and delete their own Reviews 
- Update styling for the Search bar 
- Creating a User profile
